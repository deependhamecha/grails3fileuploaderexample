# Grails 3 File Uploader Example

- This repo is based on an example presented on [site](http://grails.asia/grails-example-application-simple-document-management-system).

- Alternative approach is also provided in `DocumentController` commented as **New METHOD**.

> Note : It is not necessary to make a domain class. Domain class is used for displaying purpose in `list` view.

This is the most short and crisp method to file upload in grails 3.

> Grails 2 refer docs of `file uploader` plugin.
